      "This was an absolutely terrible movie. Don't be lured in by Christopher Walken or Michael Ironside. Both are great actors, but this must simply be their worst role in history. Even their great acting could not redeem this movie's ridiculous storyline. This movie is an early nineties US propaganda piece. The most pathetic scenes were those when the Columbian rebels were making their cases for revolutions. Maria Conchita Alonso appeared phony, and her pseudo-love affair with Walken was nothing but a pathetic emotional plug in a movie that was devoid of any real meaning. I am disappointed that there are movies like this, ruining actor's like Christopher Walken's good name. I could barely sit through it.\n"

    "In this lab, you saw how subword text encoding can be a robust technique to avoid out-of-vocabulary tokens. It can decode uncommon words it hasn't seen before even with a relatively small vocab size. Consequently, it results in longer token sequences when compared to full word tokenization. Next week, you will look at other architectures that you can use when building your classifier. These will be recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks."
